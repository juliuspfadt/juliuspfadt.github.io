# About
Hello. 

This site is supposed to portray most of my professional output. I am a PhD candidate in psychological research methods at Ulm University; hopefully soon-to-be Doctor of Natural Sciences (Dr. rer. nat.). 

Sometime in the future, the site may also contain some of my non-work related adventures. We'll see.
