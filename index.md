# About
Hello. 

I am a researcher in psychological research methods at Ulm University. 
I recently received my PhD with distinction (summa cum laude) for my thesis titled "The Present and Future of Reliability Analysis: Advances in Theory and Practice".

My professional interest lies with statistical modeling: in particular, developing methods to help researchers learn about unobservable patterns in their data. These methods are ideally, but not exclusively, Bayesian. So far, I have mainly focused on methods for psychometrics, specifically, reliability estimation and structural equation modeling. 

I strongly believe that science should be accessible to everyone. Therefore, I try to publish open-access whenever possible and implement all methods I develop in free and open-source software, i.e., R and JASP.
